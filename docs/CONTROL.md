# GIO4X Control

The internal console at `/control`. It reads and triages enquiries, runs the sales pipeline and its
follow-ups, reads newsletter subscriptions and the audit log, and manages who is on staff. It is not linked from the public site and is never indexed, but neither of
those is the protection: access is decided on the server for every request and enforced again by the
database. See `docs/SECURITY.md` for the model.

## How it looks, and why

At the owner's request Control wears the look of the earlier staff console, the "Service Console": a navy
sidebar with the logo on a white card, the signed-in person, the full menu with icons and sign-out at the
foot; white rounded cards on a pale slate ground; sky accents; Inter throughout. Only the look is taken
from it. The screens, the access rules and the database are this project's.

- The palette and component overrides are in `src/styles/console.css`, scoped to `.gx-console`. The
  console has its own look, independent of the public site's theme: light or dark, and six palettes (Navy,
  the default, Graphite, Emerald, Royal, Ocean, Mono), chosen with the switcher at the foot of the sidebar.
  It is kept per browser in `localStorage` under `gxc:look` and applied before paint
  (`src/components/control/look.ts`, `LookBoot.tsx`, `LookSwitch.tsx`).
- The console keeps one more thing in the browser: `gxc:notify`, JSON `{ "browser": true }`, present only
  while a member of staff has chosen "Also notify me on this computer" in the bell's panel, and removed
  when they switch it off (`src/components/control/notify.ts`). It is never sent anywhere. There is no
  push service and no service worker: a system notification can be raised only by an open console tab.
- The menu is `src/components/control/nav-items.ts`: the Service Console's sections in their familiar
  order, plus Pipeline, Follow-ups, Subscribers and Audit log. Icons are drawn in
  `src/components/control/icons.tsx`; no icon package is installed.
- A section with no screens yet is listed with a "Soon" tag and opens a page that says what it will do and
  what it is waiting for (`src/components/control/sections.ts`, route `/control/[section]`). Those pages
  read nothing from the database and show no figures.
- Below `lg` the sidebar becomes a navy top bar with a menu button.

## What is in it

| Route | Purpose | Who |
|---|---|---|
| `/control/sign-in` | Email and password. No sign-up. | anyone |
| `/control` | Enquiries by status, new enquiries without an owner, the newest eight, subscription count | staff |
| `/control/pipeline` | One column per stage with its count and highest-scoring enquiries | `leads.read` |
| `/control/leads` | All enquiries; filter by status, stage and topic, order by date or score, search by reference or email; 25 per page | `leads.read` |
| `/control/leads/[id]` | The enquiry, consent evidence, status, stage, score with its reasons, assignment, follow-ups, internal notes, history, other enquiries from the same address | `leads.read` (changes: `leads.write`, `tasks.write`) |
| `/control/tasks` | Follow-ups: mine or everyone's, open or completed; 50 per page | `leads.read` (complete: `tasks.write`) |
| `/control/staff` | Who is on staff, requests to change that, and their approval | `staff.read` (changes: `staff.manage`) |
| `/control/subscribers` | Subscriptions with consent evidence; 50 per page | staff |
| `/control/subscribers/export` (POST) | CSV export, recorded in the audit log | admin |
| `/control/audit` | The audit log; 50 per page | staff |
| `/control/tickets` | Support requests opened on the website at `/support`: the queue, filters, reply-due marker against the internal target | `tickets.read` |
| `/control/tickets/[id]` | One request: thread, reply to the customer, internal notes, status, priority, category, assignment, history | `tickets.read` (changes: `tickets.write`; assign a colleague: `leads.assign`) |
| `/control/chats` | Live chat with website visitors. The website offers chat only while it is switched on in Configuration and someone has this screen open | `chats.read` (answer: `chats.write`) |
| `/control/customers`, `/control/customers/[key]` | Everyone who has contacted GIO4X, one record per address: enquiries, tickets, subscription. Not client accounts. The key is a hash, so no address appears in a URL. Each record opens on a timeline of that person's history (each kind of event only for a role that could see it on its own screen; live chats are not in it, because a chat carries no address) and holds internal notes with @mentions, which can be added and never changed (0019) | `customers.read` (write a note: `customers.note`) |
| `/control/compliance` | Register of complaints, privacy requests and security reports, drawn from tickets and enquiries, oldest open first | `compliance.read` |
| `/control/reports` | Counts over 7, 30, 90 or 365 days: enquiries, support, chat, newsletter, follow-ups | `reports.read` |
| `/control/analytics` | The website's own visit counts over 7, 30, 90 or 365 UTC days: page views per day, most viewed pages, kind of referrer, forms accepted against views of their page, searches and the site terms searched for. Daily totals only: nothing about any visitor, no third-party tracker (see `docs/SECURITY.md`, section 11) | `analytics.read` |
| `/control/reports/leads-export` (POST) | CSV export of enquiries, recorded in the audit log | `subscribers.export` |
| `/control/reports/summary?month=YYYY-MM` | One calendar month (UTC) in counts, laid out for print on A4; the browser's Print, then "Save as PDF", makes the file. The current month and the eleven before it. Counts only | `reports.read` |
| `/control/reports/summary-export` (POST) | The same month as a CSV file of `section,metric,value`, recorded in the audit log before it is sent. Scheduled delivery by e-mail is not built: there is no sending domain | `reports.read` |
| `/control/activity` | Team activity: per member of staff over 7, 30 or 90 days, what the console recorded (tickets, live chat, enquiries, last audit entry), with each column defined on the page. Counts of events, not a measure of quality. Without `activity.read` a member of staff sees their own figures only | `activity.read` (own row: any staff) |
| `/control/command` | What needs attention now, across every section | `command.read` |
| `/control/config` | The website's announcement line, the live-chat switch, support hours, and notices for the public Status page | `config.manage` |
| `/control/blog`, `/control/blog/new`, `/control/blog/[id]` | The daily blog's CMS: write in restricted Markdown, preview, SEO fields (title, description, canonical, noindex, share picture), cover picture with alt text, caption, credit and size, schedule and publish, corrections | `blog.read` (write: `blog.write`; publish, unpublish, archive, edit a published post: `blog.publish`) |
| `/control/blog/calendar?month=YYYY-MM` | The editorial calendar: one month of UTC days with the posts published or scheduled on each, and a tray of drafts and posts ready for review. Drag a post onto a day to schedule it (09:00 UTC unless changed), onto another day to move it, back to the tray to unschedule it; every chip has a menu that does the same from the keyboard. A dialog states the exact date and time before anything is saved. A past day is refused: publishing immediately is the editor's job. Below 820px the month is an agenda list. A post already on the website is not the calendar's to move | `blog.read` (schedule, move, unschedule: `blog.publish`) |
| `/control/blog/[id]`, "History of the text" | The post's revisions (who, when, what changed), a word-level comparison of any two or of one with what is in the editor, and "Restore", which copies a revision into the editor's fields as unsaved changes and saves nothing. Written by the database (`0020`): the latest 50 per post and the revision current at each publication | `blog.read` (restore: whoever may edit the post) |
| `/control/blog/upload` (POST) | Picture upload to the public `blog` storage bucket: 4 MB, JPEG, PNG, WebP or AVIF, checked by content | `blog.write` |
| `/control/media` | The media library: every picture in the `blog` bucket, newest first, 48 per page, with the posts that use each (cover, share picture, body), copy path and copy Markdown, filters by use and month. Nothing can be deleted: no role has that right. A second, read-only tab lists the pictures shipped in `public/` (from `src/data/generated/site-images.json`, made by `scripts/site-images.mjs` before each build) | `blog.read` (upload: `blog.write`, through `/control/blog/upload`) |
| `/control/media/list` (GET) | The newest pictures as JSON, for the blog editor's "Choose from the library" picker. Never cached | `blog.read` |
| `/control/seo` | SEO health: the website's own pages, sitemaps, feeds and robots.txt, fetched anonymously from the request's own host (GET only, never `/control` or `/api`, bounded, read in parts kept for ten minutes), with titles, descriptions, h1, canonical, broken internal links, sitemap entries that 404, redirect chains and noindex; and what published posts are missing. Redirects are shown read-only from `src/config/redirects.json` | `blog.read` |
| `/control/leads/new` | An enquiry entered by staff (telephone, event, referral). Marked as staff-entered; stores no consent | `leads.write` |
| "Views" on Leads, Tickets, Follow-ups and Blog | A person's own saved filters for that screen: save, rename, pin, delete; at most 30. A view is the screen's address with its filters; search text is never saved. Pinned views appear under "Your desk" on the dashboard with a live count, beside the person's own tickets, enquiries, follow-ups and chats waiting. Nobody sees a colleague's views | staff (the screen's own capability) |
| `/control/notifications` | The person's notifications, 25 per page: a ticket, enquiry or follow-up assigned to them, a customer's reply on their ticket, a staff change or blog post waiting for them, a visitor waiting in chat. Written by database triggers; titles carry a reference, never a customer's name. Read ones are removed after 30 days, all after 90 | staff (own rows only) |
| `/control/notifications/feed` (GET), `/control/notifications/read` (POST) | What the bell in the sidebar and the phone bar uses: the unread count and the latest 30, asked every 30 seconds while the tab is visible; and marking read. Never cached | staff (own rows only) |
| `/control/kyc` | Clients' verification status and document records in the portal. With `kyc.decide`: accept or reject one document awaiting review, recorded in the audit log first | `kyc.read`, `kyc.decide` |
| `/control/funds` | Wallet transactions and transfers in the portal. With `funds.settle`: approve or reject one pending deposit or withdrawal. An approval takes two people (one asks, another confirms); a rejection takes one. Each step is in the audit log | `funds.read`, `funds.settle` |
| `/control/kyc/file/<id>` (GET) | Opens a client's uploaded document in a new tab through a one-minute link; recorded in the audit log first | `kyc.read` |
| `/control/fees` | Fee schedules, rules and charges in the portal. With `fees.manage`: add, change or retire a schedule or a rule (nothing is deleted) | `funds.read`, `fees.manage` |
| `/control/ledger` | Ledger accounts and journal entries, as the portal holds them. Read only | `funds.read` |
| `/control/ib`, `/control/ib/<id>` | The IB network: partners with parent, plan, downline counts and commission owed; one page per person with their downline, commission by currency and referral links. With `partners.manage`: make a client an IB or the reverse, place a person under an IB, move or detach them, set the plan and share of a link. With `partners.settle`: pay commission awaiting settlement (two people) | `partners.read`, `partners.manage`, `partners.settle` |
| `/control/ib` (commission plans), `/control/broker` (account types) | With `partners.manage` / `trading.manage`: add, change or retire a commission plan / an account type | `partners.manage`, `trading.manage` |
| `/control/ib`, `/control/copy`, `/control/pamm` | Introducing brokers, commission and referral records; signal providers and subscriptions; managed funds and investments. Read only | `partners.read` |
| `/control/trades`, `/control/broker` | The portal's trade records; account types, trading accounts and switches. Read only | `trading.read` |
| `/control/events` | The portal's event outbox: what is waiting and what was processed. With `events.manage`: run the queue now | `events.read`, `events.manage` |
| `/control/copy`, `/control/pamm` | With `partners.manage`: approve, pause, resume or close a signal provider / a fund (closed is final; not while clients are in it) | `partners.manage` |
| `/control/ledger` | With `ledger.manage`: add a ledger account, switch one off or on, post a manual two-line journal entry | `ledger.manage` |
| `/control/documents` | The legal documents the portal publishes. With `documents.manage`: edit a text (the version rises), publish it to clients or take it down, add a document | `documents.read`, `documents.manage` |
| `/control/emailer` | The record of e-mails sent. With `emailer.send` and a configured provider (`RESEND_API_KEY`): one plain-text service message to a fixed audience, confirmed by typing the recipient count | `emailer.read`, `emailer.send` |
| `/control/clients`, `/control/clients/<id>` | The portal's client accounts; one page per client (profile, wallets, accounts, KYC, latest transactions and trades). With `clients.manage`: activate, suspend or close. With `fees.charge`: charge a fee by hand (two people) | `clients.read`, `clients.manage`, `fees.charge` |
| `/control/marketing` | Marketing materials for IBs (a title and the https address of the file) and every campaign link. With `partners.manage`: add, change, retire a material | `partners.read`, `partners.manage` |
| `/control/broker` (terminal) | Per-symbol conditions and trading blocks on the trading terminal (`RAPTOR_BRIDGE_URL`, `RAPTOR_BRIDGE_SERVICE_KEY`). With `trading.manage`: change one value of one symbol; add a block or end one | `trading.read`, `trading.manage` |
| `/control/trades` (entry) | With `trading.manage`: enter a closed trade by hand; the portal charges commission and pays rebates on it as on any trade | `trading.manage` |
| `/control/fees` (by hand) | With `fees.charge`: waive a pending charge; reverse an applied one (two people); confirm a charge another person asked for | `fees.charge` |
| `/control/content/files`, `/control/content/files/<id>`, `…/download` | Traders' files: the source of an EA, indicator or script sent from the Rule bench page. The list, one file's text, and the file as a plain-text download. Kept to be read: never run, never shown on the website. Mark as read, put away or put back | `content.read` (status: `content.publish`) |
| `/control/<section>` | A section listed in the menu before it is built: what it will do and what it is waiting for. None at present | staff |

### How the console reaches the website

| On the website | Comes from |
|---|---|
| `/support`: open a request, look it up with reference and e-mail, read the reply, answer | Tickets. A staff reply appears there; the console sends no e-mail |
| The chat button (only when chat is available) | Live Chats and the chat switch in Configuration |
| The announcement line under the header | Configuration |
| "Notices from GIO4X" on `/status` | Incidents in Configuration, when published. Written by staff; not monitoring |
| Support hours on `/support` | Configuration |
| (The other direction) page views, accepted forms and searches on the public pages | Counted by the website and read in Analytics. What is counted is published at `/legal/cookies`, "Counting visits" |

Times are shown in UTC, for everyone.

## Roles and capabilities

A role is a named set of capabilities. Policies and actions never name a role: they ask
`staff_can('leads.write')`. The mapping lives in the table `role_capabilities` (migration `0004`), which no
API role can read or write. A new module adds its capabilities with an `INSERT` in its own migration.

| Role | Can today |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Everything: all of the below, assign to anyone, export subscribers and enquiries, manage staff, Configuration, Command Centre. |
| `compliance` | Read enquiries, tickets, chats, customers, subscribers, the audit log and the staff list; the Compliance register and reports. Change nothing. |
| `sales`, `agent` | Read enquiries, tickets, chats, customers, subscribers and the audit log; change status and stage, take or release an enquiry, add notes and follow-ups; answer chats. `agent` also works tickets; `sales` also reads reports. |
| `support` | Enquiries as sales, without subscribers or reports; works tickets and answers chats. |
| `finance`, `dealing` | Read the audit log; `finance` also reads reports. Since `0021`: `finance` reads the portal's funds, partner and trading records, `dealing` its trading records. |
| `viewer` | Read enquiries, tickets, chats, customers, subscribers and the audit log. Change nothing. |

Capabilities: `leads.read`, `leads.write`, `leads.assign`, `tasks.write`, `subscribers.read`,
`subscribers.export`, `audit.read`, `staff.read`, `staff.manage`, `tickets.read`, `tickets.write`,
`chats.read`, `chats.write`, `customers.read`, `compliance.read`, `reports.read`, `analytics.read`, `command.read`,
`config.manage`, `blog.read`, `blog.write`, `blog.publish`. The TypeScript list is
`CAPABILITIES` in `src/lib/server/constants.ts`; the console's menu is filtered by them in
`src/components/control/nav-items.ts`.

A member of staff can be switched off (`active = false`) instead of deleted. An inactive row grants
nothing, and the person's name stays on the notes and audit entries they wrote.

## Status, stage and score

- **Status** says where the conversation is: New, Open, Waiting, Resolved, Spam.
- **Stage** says where the relationship is: Enquiry, Contacted, Qualified, Applying, Client, Lost. A lost
  enquiry always carries a reason; the database refuses one without it and clears the reason when the
  stage moves on.
- **Score** is 0 to 100, a generated column computed by the database from what the enquirer told us
  (topic, account type named, phone, country, marketing consent, campaign link). Complaints, press,
  privacy, security and technical enquiries score 0: they are matters to resolve, not sales leads. The
  lead page lists the reasons. The rules are in `0005_crm.sql` and restated in
  `src/components/control/score.ts`; change both together.

## Follow-ups

A follow-up is one line, a due time (UTC) and an owner, added on the enquiry it belongs to. It is created
for oneself unless the person holds `leads.assign`. Completing and reopening record who and when. The
overview shows your own follow-ups that are overdue or due within 24 hours.

## Staff changes and four eyes

Every change to staff access made in the console is a **request** (`staff_changes`). It is applied when a
second person holding `staff.manage` approves it. The database refuses anyone approving their own request
or a request about themselves, and refuses a change that would leave nobody able to manage staff.

One exception, stated plainly: when no active manager exists other than the requester and the person the
request is about, nobody could approve, so the request is applied at once and marked **unreviewed**. That is
how the first colleague is added, and how one of two admins can still remove the other. Each such case is
shown on the Staff page and in the audit log.

The console cannot create a sign-in account: it holds no key that could. Create the user in Supabase under
Authentication, Users, then use "Give someone access" on the Staff page with the same address.

Nobody can edit or delete an enquiry, a note, a subscription or an audit entry through the console or the
API. Those are SQL operations for the owner.

## How an enquiry flows

1. A visitor submits the contact form or the account-interest form. `POST /api/contact` validates it and
   stores it with status **New** and a reference such as `GX-7K2MQ4XA`, which the visitor is shown.
2. It appears on the overview and in Leads. A member of staff opens it and takes it (**Assign to me**) or an
   admin assigns it.
3. Status moves as the work does: **Open** (being handled), **Waiting** (waiting for the enquirer),
   **Resolved** (closed), or **Spam**.
4. Notes record what was done. They are internal and are never sent to the enquirer.
5. Every status change, assignment and note is written to the audit log by the database, with who and when.

The console does not send email. Reply from your own mailbox (the email address on the enquiry is a
`mailto:` link) and note what you sent.

Consent: each enquiry records that the privacy notice was accepted, when, and against which policy version.
Marketing consent is separate and is off unless the visitor ticked it. **Do not add an address to any mailing
unless "Marketing: Opted in" is shown.**

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Publishable key (safe in a browser) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Canonical site origin; also accepted by the forms' same-origin check |
| `PRIVACY_POLICY_VERSION` | The version of the published Privacy Policy recorded with each consent (letters, digits, `. _ -`, max 40). Until it is set, rows are recorded as `unversioned`. Change it whenever the policy changes. |

If the Supabase variables are missing, the forms answer 503 with a generic message and `/control` shows
"Not configured".

## Applying the migrations

Files, in order:

1. `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`: tables, constraints, indexes; RLS enabled and forced; all API
   privileges revoked.
2. `supabase/migrations/0002_security.sql`: helper functions, precise grants, policies.
3. `supabase/migrations/0003_triggers.sql`: throttles, timestamps, audit triggers, append-only guard.
4. `supabase/migrations/0004_capabilities.sql`: roles by capability, the active switch, staff requests
   and the functions that apply them.
5. `supabase/migrations/0005_crm.sql`: pipeline stage, lost reason, score, follow-up tasks.
6. `supabase/migrations/0006_site.sql`: what staff publish to the website (announcement, chat switch,
   support hours) and incident notices for the Status page.
7. `supabase/migrations/0007_support.sql`: support tickets and their messages; the public lookup and reply
   functions.
8. `supabase/migrations/0008_chat.sql`: live chat, staff presence, and the functions a visitor talks through.
9. `supabase/migrations/0009_insight.sql`: customers (people who wrote in), report and command summaries,
   the record of an enquiries export.
10. `supabase/migrations/0010_person_scope.sql`: a person's record lists enquiries and tickets only to
    roles that hold `leads.read` and `tickets.read`.
11. `supabase/migrations/0011_blog.sql`: the daily blog's posts, the rule that only `blog.publish` may put
    words in front of the public or change them once there, and the public `blog` picture bucket.
12. `supabase/migrations/0012_manual_leads.sql`: enquiries entered by staff: `origin`, `added_by`, no
    consent evidence, and `lead_add_manual()`.
14. `supabase/migrations/0014_pulse.sql`: the website's visit counter: daily totals of page views, accepted
    forms and searches, the functions that add to them, and `pulse_summary()` for `analytics.read` (admin,
    sales, compliance). Tests: `supabase/tests/0014_pulse.sql`.
15. `supabase/migrations/0015_activity.sql`: no table, five functions: `staff_activity()` for `activity.read`
    (admin, compliance), `my_activity()` for the caller's own row, `report_month()` and
    `record_report_download()` for `reports.read`. Tests: `supabase/tests/0015_activity.sql`.
18. `supabase/migrations/0018_personal.sql`: `staff_views` (a person's own saved filters, at most 30, readable
    and writable by its owner only) and `staff_notifications` (written only by the `zz_notify_…` triggers,
    which can never fail the action that fires them; read by the recipient only; marked read by
    `notifications_mark_read()`, which also runs the retention). Tests: `supabase/tests/0018_personal.sql`.
20. `supabase/migrations/0020_blog_revisions.sql`: `blog_revisions`, the words of a post after each saved
    change to them, written only by the trigger `blog_posts_keep_revision` (which can never fail a save);
    the latest 50 per post, plus the revision current at each publication; read with `blog.read`, written
    by nobody through the API. Tests: `supabase/tests/0020_blog_revisions.sql`.

Apply them as the `postgres` role (the Supabase SQL editor, `supabase db push`, or the Supabase MCP
`apply_migration`). `0002` stops with a clear error if the applying role cannot bypass RLS, because the
helper functions depend on it. Each file can be re-run. The database is safe after each step: after `0001`
alone, nothing is reachable through the API at all.

Afterwards run the checks in `docs/SECURITY.md`, section 3, and the Supabase security advisor.

Recommended Supabase Auth settings before the first account is created: public sign-ups **off**, email
confirmation on, leaked-password protection on.

## Managing staff in SQL (owner only)

The Staff page is the normal route. SQL remains for the cases it cannot cover: the first admin, changing
your own row, or recovering access. SQL changes are not requests and are not reviewed; the audit log
records them with the actor "Database (SQL)".

```sql
-- add a colleague (create their user in Authentication → Users first)
insert into public.staff (user_id, role, display_name)
select id, 'agent', 'Colleague Name' from auth.users where email = 'colleague@example.com';

-- change a role
update public.staff set role = 'viewer'
where user_id = (select id from auth.users where email = 'colleague@example.com');

-- remove access (their enquiries become unassigned; their notes and audit entries remain)
delete from public.staff
where user_id = (select id from auth.users where email = 'colleague@example.com');
```

Each of these is recorded in the audit log automatically. To end a person's access completely, also delete
or ban the user in **Authentication → Users**, which invalidates their sessions.

Keep at least two admins once there is a second trusted person, so that one lost password does not lock
the console.

## Creating the first admin

There are no default accounts and no passwords in the repository.

1. In the Supabase dashboard: **Authentication → Users → Add user**. Enter your email address and a strong,
   unique password (use a password manager), and mark the email as confirmed.
2. In the **SQL editor**, run this once, with your own email address and name:

```sql
insert into public.staff (user_id, role, display_name)
select id, 'admin', 'Your Name'
from auth.users
where email = 'you@example.com';

-- confirm: exactly one row, role admin
select s.user_id, u.email, s.role, s.display_name, s.created_at
from public.staff s
join auth.users u on u.id = s.user_id;
```

If the `insert` reports `INSERT 0 0`, the email address did not match a user: check step 1.

3. Open `/control/sign-in` and sign in. Then enrol in MFA when it is enabled (see `docs/SECURITY.md`,
   section 10).
