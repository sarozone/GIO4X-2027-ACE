# Play: the machines, the games and the verse

What was added to the website so that ideas can be handled, not only read. Everything here follows the site's data-honesty rule: **nothing fabricated is presented as real**. Every chart in these pages is generated and says so; every figure is either arithmetic the visitor can check or a plainly labelled example; nothing predicts a market.

## Where things are

| Page | What it holds | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `/labs/workshop` | Candle forge, leverage tightrope, guess the candle, pip reels, sixty seconds | `src/components/labs/workshop/` |
| `/labs/engine-room` | Margin-call countdown, swap clock, slippage in slow motion, compounding staircase, correlation dance, marbles | `src/components/labs/engine/Machines.tsx` |
| `/labs/forces` | Tug of war, lever room, shockwave, liquidity tide | `src/components/labs/forces/Models.tsx` |
| `/labs/scale` | The Long Scroll: a tick to a decade | `src/components/labs/scale/` |
| `/labs/cinema` | The floor at night, order in flight, spread canyon, storm chart, gravity wells, the city in time-lapse | `src/components/labs/cinema/Pieces.tsx` |
| `/labs/mind` | Spot the coin flips, the patience game, the bias detector, the headline game | `src/components/labs/mind/Games.tsx` |
| `/academy/practice` | Build the order, fix the trade, flashcard duel, mistake museum, certificate | `src/components/academy/practice/` |
| `/verse` | Weekly riddle, alphabet, finish the rhyme, proverb wall, riddle hunt | `src/components/verse/Verse.tsx` |
| Home | Daily riddle, weekly verse, the chart the sequence resolves into | `src/components/play/`, `src/components/home/SequenceChart.tsx` |
| My desk | Passport, constellation | `src/components/play/` |

A page that is a row of machines is built with `MachinePage` (`src/components/labs/MachinePage.tsx`): it takes the words and the machines and supplies the rest.

## How a machine is made

A machine is a client component: a `Figure` canvas (`src/components/figures/Figure.tsx`), ordinary controls beneath it (buttons, a range input) and one sentence in an `aria-live` paragraph that says what the canvas is showing. The canvas is decoration for assistive technology; the sentence carries the meaning.

- `Stage`, `Slider` and `Note` are in `src/components/labs/kit.tsx`.
- The canvas redraws every frame while on screen. Under reduced motion or low visual effects it draws one still frame, so a machine passes `rev` (a number that changes with its controls) to have that frame drawn again.
- On a phone a canvas is never shallower than about 4:3 (the kit does this).
- `Figure` ignores touch on purpose, so a finger scrolls the page. A machine that must be dragged (the order builder) lays its own element over the canvas and also offers sliders that do the same thing.
- Seeded randomness comes from `src/components/labs/workshop/rng.ts`. A new seed per round is drawn in the browser on a click, never during rendering.
- The timetable (which FX windows and which exchanges are open at an hour) is `src/components/labs/timetable.ts`, read from `src/lib/sessions.ts`: the same table the clocks use.

## Words

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| A line to remember per section | `src/data/punchlines.ts`, shown by `src/components/ui/PunchLine.tsx` |
| A couplet per glossary term | `src/data/glossary-couplets.ts` |
| A couplet per tool | `src/data/tool-rhymes.ts` |
| A limerick per lesson | `src/data/limericks.ts` |
| The daily riddles | `src/data/riddles.ts` |

The rule for all of them: a line may describe what a word means or urge care, cost-awareness and method. It may not promise a result, play down risk or tell anyone to trade.

## What is stored

One browser-storage key, `gx:play` (`src/components/play/store.ts`), listed in `LOCAL_KEYS`, described in the privacy controls and in the Cookie & Storage Notice, and removed by the privacy reset:

- `r` the daily riddle's run of days
- `b` the best score in Sixty seconds
- `h` which hidden riddles have been solved
- `s` the passport's stamps, present only once the visitor has started it
- `v` the newest "recently added" ribbon the visitor has dismissed (`src/data/releases.ts`)

Each is written only by something the visitor does. Nothing else added here stores anything: tallies, names typed on a certificate and the ambient sound last only as long as the page.

## Sound

The machines use the site's existing sound signals (`src/components/sound/signal.ts`), which are silent unless sound is switched on at `/preferences`. The ambient drone (`src/components/fx/Extras.tsx`) is separate, off by default and lasts for one visit.

## Polish, and the later additions

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| The one card every figure and machine is drawn in (`.gx-stage`), its pointer light, the grain, dividers that draw themselves, display numerals, drop caps, waiting states | `src/styles/fx.css` (section POLISH) |
| Pointer light, keyboard shortcuts on `[data-machine]`, the part of the day on `<html data-daypart>` | `src/components/fx/Polish.tsx` |
| A cover drawn from a slug, for posts and lessons without a picture | `src/components/ui/GeneratedCover.tsx` |
| Liquid chart, candle garden, paper trail, build a candle, draw a chart, risk dial | `src/components/labs/more/More.tsx` |
| First-trade course, scroll-told leverage story, term of the day, footer motto, "recently added" ribbon | `src/components/play/Guided.tsx` |
| Cheat sheets to print | `src/app/(site)/academy/cheat-sheets/page.tsx` |
| The glossary as a star map | `src/components/glossary/StarMap.tsx` |
| Account cards | `src/components/trading/AccountCards.tsx` |
| Sonnet of the month, readers' riddles and their form | `src/components/verse/Readers.tsx` |

Readers' riddles are the only part of this that leaves the browser. A riddle is posted to `/api/riddle`, stored as `pending` in `reader_riddles` (migration `0029`), and is shown on `/verse` only after someone with `content.publish` approves it at `/control/content/riddles`. The database forces `pending` on insert whatever the request says. The `/verse` page re-reads approved riddles every five minutes.

The leverage story's six drawings are `src/components/play/LeverageScenes.ts`, one function for each step; `/academy/leverage-story?step=4` opens the story at a step. The hero scenes of these pages are in `src/components/cockpit/scenes/` (`firsttrade`, `dojo`, `lever`, `blueprint`, `starmap`, `quill`), chosen by path in `src/components/cockpit/routes.ts`.

## Fun@Finance

`/fun` is jokes, comic strips, cartoons, limericks, riddles, a mock dictionary, an excuse machine and a bingo card. All of the material is in `src/data/fun.ts`, written for the page; the rule it keeps is at the top of that file (laugh at habits and jargon; never promise a result, make light of real loss, give advice, or name a real person or firm). The cast of the comics (the Bull, the Bear and Wick) is drawn in SVG by `src/components/fun/Toons.tsx`: a new strip is three panels of data, with no drawing to do. The moving parts are `src/components/fun/Fun.tsx`. Nothing on the page is stored.

## The Playbook, and Nice & Need

`/playbook` is twelve candlestick patterns and twelve situations, one page each at `/playbook/[slug]`, all from `src/data/playbook.ts`. An entry carries its own candles (invented, to show the shape), which `src/components/playbook/PlayFigure.tsx` draws and rings. A page explains and never instructs: what a thing is, what it is taken to mean, what to check, where people go wrong. To add a page, add an entry; the sitemap, the index and the links between pages follow.

`/nice-and-need` lists free resources on other websites (`src/data/nice-and-need.ts`), each a well-known public source, with the free things on this site beneath. The page states that GIO4X has no connection with the sites listed. The footer has a column of the same name.

## Moods colour the whole page

A mood (accent) now tints the page's materials as well as what is drawn on it (`src/styles/accent.css`, last section). Four moods were added: Sunset, Rose, Forest, Slate. A mood needs: its key in `Prefs["accent"]` and `ACCENTS` (`src/lib/prefs.ts`), a swatch in `src/components/shell/Appearance.tsx`, light and dark colours in `src/styles/tokens.css`, and night colours in `src/styles/accent.css`.

## The Rule bench, and traders' files

`/labs/rule-bench` lets a visitor build a trading rule from parts (an entry, a stop, a target, a risk per trade) and test it on invented prices. The engine is `src/components/labs/bench/strategy.ts`, a pure module proved by `node scripts/test-bench.mjs`; the page's moving part is `RuleBench.tsx` beside it. There is one invented market for each kind of instrument the site describes. After the one test it shows, the bench runs the same rule on forty other market numbers and draws all forty results: the prices are a random walk, no rule has an edge on them, and the page says so. It is not a strategy tester: MQL runs only in MetaTrader and Pine Script only in TradingView, and nothing a visitor sends is ever run. Nothing is stored.

On the same page a visitor can send the source of an EA, an indicator or a script (`FileForm.tsx`). The file is read as text in the browser (`.mq4`, `.mq5`, `.mqh`, `.pine`, `.txt`, up to 150 KB; a compiled file is refused), posted to `/api/trader-file` and stored in `trader_files` (migration `0030`). The public cannot read any file back. Staff read them at `/control/content/files` (`content.read`), open one to see its text or download it as plain text, and mark it read or put it away (`content.publish`). No e-mail address is asked for, so nobody is contacted. The limits shared by the form, the endpoint and the console are in `src/lib/trader-file.ts`; the database states them again and has the final say.
