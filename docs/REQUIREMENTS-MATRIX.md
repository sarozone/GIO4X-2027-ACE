# Requirements matrix

The master specification (thirteen directives, about 21,000 lines) mapped to what exists in this release.

Statuses: **IMPLEMENTED** · **PARTIAL** · **PLACEHOLDER** (designed, honest "not yet" state) ·
**NOT BUILT** · **N/A** · **BLOCKED: USER INPUT** · **BLOCKED: CREDENTIAL** · **BLOCKED: LEGAL** ·
**BLOCKED: EXTERNAL SERVICE**.

This matrix is deliberately blunt. The specification describes a programme of work far larger than one
release; the public website, its knowledge universe and a first backend slice are built, and the large
internal systems (CRM operating system, CMS, communications, generative AI) are not.
