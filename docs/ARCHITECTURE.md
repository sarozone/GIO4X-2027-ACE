## Rendering strategy

| Kind of page | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Institutional, legal, trust, academy, glossary, tools, labs, platform pages | Static (built once) |
| Instrument, asset-class, article, lesson, term, bank, event pages | Static via `generateStaticParams`; unknown slugs call `notFound()` and return a real 404. (`dynamicParams = false` is deliberately not used: it makes prerendered dynamic routes 404 on the Netlify runtime.) |
| Pages showing ECB reference fixings (`/`, `/markets`, pairs, currency strength, converter tools, Morning Room) | Static with `revalidate = 3600` |
| Time-dependent UI (sessions, clocks, greeting) | Server renders a neutral state; the client fills it from the visitor's clock (`useNow`) so nothing server-rendered is ever presented as "now" |
| `/control/**` | Dynamic, authenticated, `private, no-store`, `noindex` |
| `/api/contact`, `/api/newsletter` | Node route handlers, `no-store` |

Client JavaScript is confined to leaf components (`"use client"`): header, command bar, Lens, appearance,
market sphere, clocks, tools, graph views, forms. Content is always in the server-rendered HTML.

## Data and its honesty

There is one rule: a number is on the site only if it has a source, a status and a date.

| Status | What | Module |
|---|---|---|
| Reference | ECB daily euro reference fixings (via the Frankfurter API), cached 1 h | `src/lib/rates.ts` |
| Indicative | GIO4X's previously published trading conditions | `src/data/instruments.ts`, `src/data/accounts.ts` |
| Schedule | Session and exchange-hour states computed from the device clock | `src/lib/sessions.ts` |
| Simulation | Calculations on the visitor's own inputs | `src/components/tools/*` |
| Third-party chart | TradingView iframe, loaded on request, attributed | `src/components/markets/*` |
| Unavailable | A designed state. Never zeros, never stale values | everywhere |

**Provider abstraction.** UI components depend on the shapes exported by `src/lib/rates.ts`
(`ReferenceRates`, `crossRate`, `crossChange`, `crossSeries`, `strength`, `correlation`), not on the provider.
To connect a licensed feed, implement the same shape in a new module and switch the import; add new
services (economic calendar, policy rates, news) beside it with the same `ok | unavailable` contract.
External payloads are validated at runtime before use.

**Commodities A to Z (added 5 October 2026).** `/markets/commodities` and `/markets/commodities/[slug]` are a
general reference generated from `src/data/commodities.ts`: what each commodity is, its usual unit, where its
reference contract is listed, what commonly moves it and where it comes from. The file holds no price, tonnage,
market share or forecast. Only the entries with a `gio4x` field are GIO4X instruments (they resolve through
`getInstrument`, so the list follows `instruments.ts`); every other page states that it is not offered. It is not
an asset class: `AssetClassKey` is unchanged, and the static `commodities` folder is served ahead of the dynamic
`markets/[class]` route. The pages are registered in the navigation, the markets sitemap, the search index, the
A to Z index (`src/data/az-extra.ts`), `llms.txt`, the hero scene map and `src/data/releases.ts`. The entries were
written from general knowledge and should be read by a person before they are promoted.

## The knowledge graph

`src/data/graph.ts` derives nodes and typed edges from the data modules (instruments, currencies, central
banks, events, glossary concepts, tools, platforms). It powers the Market Universe, Connect the Dots,
Market DNA / related links and the Lens "Related" view (through `/graph.json`). Relations are curated and
explanatory ("is quoted in", "is issued by", "is commonly watched with"); none is predictive.

## Search

`src/lib/search-index.ts` builds one index at build time from navigation and data, served as
`/search-index.json`. `src/lib/search.ts` is the engine shared by the command bar, `/search` and the 404
suggestions: symbol normalisation, aliases, typo tolerance (Damerau–Levenshtein), prefixes (`$EURUSD`,
`define:`, `calc:`, `verify:`), display commands ("switch dark mode") and a φ easter egg.
Search-result pages are `noindex`.

## Preferences and privacy

Display preferences (theme, accent, density, motion, contrast, text size, effects, underline links, time
zone) live only in `localStorage` (`gx:prefs`) and are applied to `<html data-*>` by an inline boot script
before first paint. There are no advertising scripts and no third-party analytics. The site counts
its own page views, accepted forms and searches as daily totals with no cookie and no identifier
(`src/lib/pulse.ts`, `docs/SECURITY.md` section 11; switch: `countVisits` in `gx:prefs`). Separately, `src/lib/analytics.ts` defines a
consent-gated event vocabulary that is inert until an approved tool is attached. `/preferences` lists every
key the site stores and clears them in one action.

## Portal gateway

See `docs/PORTAL-GATEWAY.md`. `src/config/destinations.ts` is the only place an outbound sign-in,
registration or platform destination can come from, and it is UNCONFIGURED by default.

## Security

See `docs/SECURITY.md`. In short: strict security headers and CSP from `next.config.mjs` (no third-party
scripts), no secrets in the client, the Supabase publishable key only, row-level security as the boundary,
insert-only public writes with validation, honeypot, timing check and rate limits, authenticated and
role-checked staff console.

## Feature switches

Everything optional degrades to a designed state rather than a broken one:

| If this is unavailable | The site shows |
|---|---|
| ECB data provider | "Reference rates are temporarily unavailable" panels; tools ask for a manual rate |
| JavaScript | All content, static session placeholders, no command bar or Lens |
| Canvas / reduced motion / low effects | A single static frame; all text content unaffected |
| Supabase | Forms fail gracefully with the contact email; `/control` says "Not configured" |
| TradingView | The chart frame is simply not loaded (it is opt-in per page view) |
| Portal URLs | "Not connected yet" gateway states |
