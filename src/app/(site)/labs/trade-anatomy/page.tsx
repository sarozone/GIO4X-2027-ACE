                The walkthrough describes how an order is commonly handled in margin trading, in the order things happen. Practice differs between brokers and platforms, which is why the text says “may”, “commonly” and “depends on the broker” where it does. The branches are the points at which two orders that look the same on the ticket can end differently.

                <strong>What it is not.</strong> There is no market data in it, no price, no symbol and no figure. It does not describe how GIO4X routes or fills orders: the note under each stage says what this site publishes on that subject and what it does not yet publish, and links to the page concerned. It is not advice, and it does not suggest a trade.

                The scene is an illustration. Everything it shows is written in the panel beside it, so the page reads the same with the animation switched off; with reduced motion each stage is a still picture and the stepper works as before. To see where each order type rests against a moving price, use{" "}
