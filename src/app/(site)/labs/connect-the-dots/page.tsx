              Each relation in the GIO4X graph has a fixed sentence pattern in both directions. For every pair of picks the page runs a breadth-first search for the shortest route, preferring structural relations (“is issued by”) over associative ones (“is commonly watched alongside”) when two routes are equally short, then prints the pattern for each step.

              <strong>No language model is involved: these sentences come from GIO4X’s curated relationship data.</strong> The same picks always give the same text. A route describes how things are documented as connected. It is not a view on where any price is going, and it is not advice.
