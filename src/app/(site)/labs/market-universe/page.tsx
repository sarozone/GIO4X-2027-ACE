                Every node here is a page that already exists on this site: an instrument, a currency, a central bank, an economic release, a glossary term, a tool or a platform. Every line between two nodes is a relation recorded in GIO4X’s own reference data, such as “is priced in”, “is issued by” or “is commonly watched alongside”.
              </p>
              <p>
                The layout is computed, not simulated: the node you choose sits at the centre, what it is directly related to sits on the first ring grouped by kind, and a selection of what those relate to sits on a second ring whose radius is φ times the first. The same choice always draws the same picture.

                <strong>What it is not.</strong> There is no language model, no market data, no score and no signal behind this map. A line says that two things are documented as connected. It says nothing about direction, timing or price, and it is not advice.
