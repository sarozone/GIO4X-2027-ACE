  { t: "The price is a seeded random walk.", d: `It starts at ${SIM.startPrice.toFixed(4)}, moves a fraction of a pip every tick of ${SIM.tickSeconds} simulated seconds, now and then runs faster for a stretch, and rarely jumps: a gap of ${MARKET.gapMinPips} to ${MARKET.gapMinPips + MARKET.gapSpanPips - 1} pips with no trading in between. The same market number always produces the same prices.` },
  { t: "Fills are at the simulated bid and ask.", d: `A buy opens at the ask and closes at the bid; a sell does the opposite. The spread is fixed at ${SIM.spreadPips} pips and is paid on entry, which is why a new position starts slightly negative.` },
  { t: "On an ordinary tick an order fills at its own level.", d: "Between two ordinary ticks the price is treated as having traded through every level in between, so a stop loss, a take profit, a limit or a stop order is filled at the price it names." },
  { t: "After a gap it fills at the first price available.", d: "Nothing traded inside a gap. A stop that the price jumped over is filled at the next bid or ask, and the journal says “slipped by” and how many pips. A stop is an instruction, not a promise of a price. A limit that was jumped over is filled at the better price." },
  { t: "Margin is set aside when a position opens.", d: "Lots × contract size × price ÷ leverage, at the fill price. An order that needs more margin than is free is refused, and a waiting order that cannot be margined when it triggers is cancelled; both are written in the journal." },
  { t: "The account is revalued every tick.", d: `Equity is the balance plus the floating result; free margin is equity less used margin; the margin level is equity ÷ used margin × 100. At or below ${SIM.marginCallLevel}% a margin call warning appears. At or below ${SIM.stopOutLevel}% positions are closed automatically, the largest loss first, until the level is above it again.` },
  { t: "Swap is charged at the simulated rollover.", d: `Every ${SIM.rolloverMinutes} simulated minutes (${ROLLOVER_TICKS} ticks) each open position is charged ${SIM.swapPerLot.toFixed(2)} ${SIM.unit} per lot, taken from the balance. A real trading day has one rollover; this one is shortened so that it arrives while you practise.` },

const differs = [
  { t: "Liquidity.", d: "Here every order of every size is filled in full, at once. A real market has a limited amount available at each price: large orders move it, quiet hours thin it, and the spread widens and narrows instead of standing still." },
  { t: "Emotions.", d: "Nothing is at stake here, so nothing is felt. Decisions made with real money, after a real loss or in a fast market, are not the decisions made on a practice desk." },
  { t: "Costs.", d: "The spread, the swap and the commission (or the absence of one) on this page are invented. Real costs depend on the account, the instrument and the moment, and they are charged whether a trade gains or loses." },
  { t: "The price itself.", d: "This price is a random walk with no news, no sessions and no other participants. It cannot be analysed, and nothing learned about its direction applies to any market." },
