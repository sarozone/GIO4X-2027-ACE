            GIO4X Intelligence follows the same rules as the rest of the site. A number in an article is a reference fixing with its date, a published trading condition marked as indicative, a figure from a named primary source, or a worked example labelled as one. Articles do not
            quote live prices, because GIO4X has no licensed source of its own for them.
