            “Published” means you can read the item on the linked page today. It does not mean a third party has verified it. “Not yet published” means the item is not on this site, either because the previous GIO4X websites never stated it or because they stated it in

            When this website was rebuilt, everything the two previous GIO4X websites said was compared line by line. Where they agreed, the fact was carried over. Where they contradicted each other, or made a statement with nothing behind it, the statement was left out and the
            subject was added to this table as not yet published.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why you will not read here that GIO4X is regulated, how fast orders are filled, or what share of clients lose money. Those are precise claims. They need a regulator’s name and a register entry, measured data, and the firm’s own client records. A row
            moves to “Published” when that evidence is on the page, and not before.
