              Four of these documents were published on the previous GIO4X website and are reproduced here sentence for sentence. They are short, they do not name a governing law, and they are being reviewed. Each one says so at the top.

              Where a sentence made a claim that could not be supported, it was taken out and an editor’s note marks the place and gives the reason. Nothing was added to the legal text. The Cookie & Storage Notice is new and describes what this website actually stores.
