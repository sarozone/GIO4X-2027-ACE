/**
 * ACCOUNT CHOOSER: the questions, and how an answer is matched to an account.
 *
 * Every fact the chooser states is read from src/data/accounts.ts at the
 * moment it is used: the minimum deposit, the minimum spread, the commission,
 * the overnight swap, what is included and who each account was published as
 * suiting. Nothing here adds a condition of its own. The match is a count of
 * published facts that agree with the answers; it is not advice, and it says
 * so on the page.
 *
 * The answers are four short codes (never free text), so the page can also
 * work as a plain GET form: /trading/accounts/choose?e=new&d=1&p=simple&n=no.
 * They describe a preference, not a person, and nothing is stored or sent
 * anywhere else.
