 *             are the only two GIO4X has published with an address (see
 *             docs/WAITING-FOR-ABE.md, item C4: other office lists carried on
 *             earlier sites were not verified, so they are not shown).
 *   centres   the nine financial centres of src/lib/sessions.ts.
 *   banks     the central banks of src/data/knowledge.ts, each with its page.
 *
 * site.ts holds postal addresses, not coordinates. An office is placed at the
 * town its published address names (Ruislip; Egmore in Chennai), to two
 * decimal places of a degree: the town, not the building. The page says so.
