/**
 * THE PASSPORT — a stamp for each kind of place on the site, collected by
 * going there.
 *
 * It is off until the visitor presses "Start my passport" on My desk. Until
 * then nothing about the pages opened is noted (the recorder below reads one
 * value and writes nothing). Once started, opening one of the places listed
 * here for a moment adds its stamp: only the stamp's short name is kept, never
 * an address, a time or an order. "Hand it back" deletes the stamps.
 *
 * Stamps mark pages opened on this device. They are not an achievement in
 * trading and the desk says so.
