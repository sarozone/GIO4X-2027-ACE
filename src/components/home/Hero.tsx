/**
 * Homepage hero: entering the GIO4X cockpit.
 *
 * The same night stage, at the same height, as every other page. Its
 * instrument is the flight-deck scene (cockpit/scenes/flightdeck.ts): the
 * globe of the world's financial centres, lit by their real regular trading
 * hours and by the real sun, with the forms of a trading floor about it. On a
 * phone it is the sky above the statement rather than a second stacked block.
 * The canvas is decorative; <CentreSummary/> says the same real information in
 * words, and the caption says what is real and what is only form.
 *
 * Depth (components/home/HomeStory.tsx reads `data-depth`): a far field of
 * points behind the instrument, the instrument itself, and the statement in
 * front, each shifting a few pixels with scroll; the far field and the
 * statement also answer the pointer. The canvas does not, because its scene
 * already turns its own camera toward the pointer.
