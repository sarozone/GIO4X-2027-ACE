/**
 * READERS' RIDDLES and THE SONNET.
 *
 * Readers' riddles: riddles sent by visitors and approved by staff, each to be
 * answered from three terms; and the form to send one. A riddle is two lines
 * and the glossary term that answers it, with optional initials. No e-mail
 * address is asked for. Nothing sent appears until a member of staff has read
 * and approved it (POST /api/riddle; GIO4X Control, Content, Readers'
 * riddles), and the form says so before anything is typed.
 *
 * The sonnet: one longer poem, a new one each month, chosen from the date.
