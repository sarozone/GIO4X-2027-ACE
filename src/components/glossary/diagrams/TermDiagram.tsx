/**
 * A glossary term's moving diagram: the drawing for the lesson's spec, the one
 * control under it, and the caption as visible text. The canvas itself is
 * hidden from assistive technology; the caption and the sentence the control
 * reports are its text alternative.
 *
 * What the pointer, a finger or the control does is the same for every diagram
 * of a kind, so it is said here, once per kind, rather than in each lesson.
