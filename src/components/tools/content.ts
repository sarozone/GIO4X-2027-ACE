If your account is held in something else, it has to be converted, and this page does that at the European Central Bank’s daily reference rate so that the step is visible.

A stop does the reverse: once triggered it is sent to be filled at whatever the next price happens to be. Stop loss and take profit are the same two instructions attached to a position that is already open: a stop loss is a stop order, a take profit is a limit order.",

The support and resistance levels are that average pushed up and down by amounts taken from the same bar. Nothing else goes in. Two people who start from the same bar get the same seven lines.",
      "The method comes from exchange floors, where the levels for the day could be worked out by hand before the opening. The variants change the recipe a little. The Fibonacci version spaces the levels at 38.2%, 61.8% and 100% of the bar’s range; Woodie’s counts the close twice; Camarilla measures from the close and keeps the levels close to it.",
      "Pivot levels are arithmetic on one past bar: a convention many traders watch, not a forecast. If a price pauses near one, part of the reason may simply be that many people have the same line on their screens. The calculation itself knows nothing about what happens next.",

An extension level is the price at which the move would have grown to a given multiple of itself. That is the whole calculation: one subtraction and one multiplication for each line.",
      "The ratios come from the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two before it: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55. Divide any number by the next and the answer settles towards 0.618: that is the 61.8% level, the ratio of neighbouring Fibonacci numbers. Skip one place and it is 0.382; skip two and it is 0.236. Divide the other way and it is 1.618. The 78.6% and 127.2% levels are the square roots of 0.618 and 1.618. The 50% level is not a Fibonacci ratio at all, and is included by convention.",
      "The golden ratio gives these tools their arithmetic. Whether the levels have predictive value is a separate question: the evidence for it is weak and disputed, and part of what is seen near a level may simply be that many traders are watching the same lines. The levels are reference points, not forecasts.",

When a position is kept open past the end of the trading day it is rolled over to the next one, and the difference between the two rates is applied to the account, together with the broker’s own margin. That adjustment is the swap.",
      "It can be a charge or a credit. Holding the currency with the higher rate against the one with the lower can produce a credit; holding it the other way round produces a charge. Because the broker’s margin is taken on both sides, the long rate and the short rate are not mirror images of each other, and both can be charges. That is why this page asks for the two separately.",

A trade in the spot market settles two business days later, so a position rolled on that night steps across the weekend, and the two days on which the market is closed are charged with it. Which night that is depends on the instrument and the broker, so the page asks only how many such nights fall inside the period.",
