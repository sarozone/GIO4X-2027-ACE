/**
 * SIXTY SECONDS — one minute on an invented price, to try to beat the desk.
 *
 * The price is a coin-flip walk from a new seed each round: four steps a
 * second, each as likely up as down. One position at a time, one fixed size,
 * and a spread of one pip paid on every trade. The score is the pips kept
 * when the minute ends.
 *
 * The lesson is in the ending. On a walk like this no method can find an edge,
 * so across many rounds the average score is what was paid in spread, and the
 * round's summary says so. It is a game about cost, not a practice of trading:
 * real markets are not this walk, and a score here says nothing about them.
 *
 * The best score is kept in this browser (gx:play), and only that.
 *
 * With `coach`, a panel beside the chart reads what the player is doing while
 * the minute runs and says what is going right, what is going wrong and what
 * to try. It comments on conduct (how often the spread is paid, how long a
 * losing trade is held, reversing after a loss), never on direction: nothing
 * predicts this price, and the panel says so. It is worked out from the round
 * in progress and kept nowhere.
