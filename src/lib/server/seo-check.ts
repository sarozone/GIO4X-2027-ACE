/**
 * SEO health: what the website actually sends, read from the website itself.
 *
 * A check fetches this site's own public pages, sitemaps, feeds and
 * robots.txt, and reports what a search engine would find: titles and meta
 * descriptions and their lengths, the number of <h1>, canonical addresses,
 * internal links that lead nowhere, sitemap entries that lead nowhere,
 * redirects that chain or end nowhere, and which pages ask not to be indexed.
 * Every figure is counted from those responses. Nothing is estimated.
 *
 * What a check may and may not do (the rules are enforced in one place,
 * `fetchOne`):
 *   · GET only.
 *   · Only this site's own origin, which the caller derives from the request
 *     it is answering (originFromHost). A redirect is never followed: its
 *     target is read from the Location header and, when it is on this site,
 *     checked as its own request.
 *   · Never /control or /api (or the framework's own files).
 *   · Anonymous: no cookie, no session and no key is sent. The pages are read
 *     exactly as a stranger reads them.
 *   · A hard cap on requests, a time limit for each, and a time budget for
 *     the work one request to the console may do.
 *
 * The site is read in parts (the documents, the pages sixteen at a time, the
 * addresses whose status alone matters), and each finished part is kept for
 * up to ten minutes (unstable_cache). So opening the screen is not a crawl each
 * time, and a site too large for one request's budget is finished by the
 * next request, which finds the earlier parts already kept. A part the budget
 * did not reach is reported as not checked, never as passing, and is never
 * kept. "Re-check now" in the console drops every kept part.
