/**
 * Story mode: what is shown beside each chapter of an Academy lesson.
 *
 * A lesson's chapters are its `h2` sections, in order, preceded by the text
 * before the first heading (the opening). Each gets one panel:
 *
 *  - a diagram from the glossary's diagram engine, with a caption; or
 *  - a quiet typographic panel showing one sentence of the chapter.
 *
 * Nothing here adds to what a lesson says. Every `caption` and every `quote`
 * is a sentence of the chapter it sits beside, word for word (a closing colon
 * may be left off); every label written here is made of words and figures
 * the lesson itself uses, and where a diagram compares sizes, the sizes are
 * the chapter's own figures. Where the chapter is about a term that has a
 * glossary lesson, `term` names it: the panel links to the term, and unless a
 * `diagram` is given here the term's own diagram is the one shown.
 *
 * .tmp/shot/story-map-check.mjs verifies all of that against the lessons.
