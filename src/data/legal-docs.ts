/**
 * LEGAL & DOCUMENT CENTRE — the registry.
 *
 * Four documents (Terms, Risk Disclosure, Privacy Policy, AML Policy) are
 * CARRIED OVER from the previous GIO4X website. Their wording is preserved
 * sentence for sentence, with three kinds of exception, every one of which is
 * recorded with the original sentence and the reason in
 * docs/CONTENT-AUDIT-LEGAL.md:
 *   1. sentences containing a flagged or conflicting claim were removed
 *      (a provider-specific retail-loss percentage, a conflicting leverage
 *      maximum, promises of protection, a withdrawal-time promise);
 *   2. one sentence that would be untrue of this website (analytics and
 *      personalisation cookies) was removed;
 *   3. typographic normalisation only (’ and — as real characters).
 * Nothing was added to the body of a carried-over document. Where a removal
 * leaves a gap, an `editor` block says so in a visibly different voice.
 *
 * "Last updated" for carried-over documents is the date printed on the
 * previous site ("March 2026"). The previous site printed no version numbers,
 * so none is invented: the version label says what the text is.
 *
 * Do not write new legal promises here. Changes need the owner's legal review.

    holds: "The glossary terms whose “Check yourself” question you answered correctly, and the Academy lessons you have completed by answering all three of their questions correctly.",
    why: "So the glossary can mark the terms you have checked and show how many, and the Academy can mark the lessons you have completed and count them by level and by learning path. No score is kept. Each can be cleared where it is shown, with “Start over”: the terms from the glossary, the lessons from the Academy.",

    holds: "The last day you answered the daily riddle correctly and your run of days in a row; your best score in the Workshop game “Sixty seconds”, in pips of an invented price; which of the five hidden riddles you have solved; the newest “recently added” notice you have put away with “Got it”; and, once you have started the passport on My desk, the short names of the stamps you have collected. No addresses, no times and nothing about you.",
    why: "So the riddle can show your run, the game can show your best, and My desk can show your passport. Each part is written only by something you do: answering a riddle, finishing a round, or pressing “Start my passport”. Handing the passport back deletes its stamps.",

    holds: "The answers you have typed into the Trading plan builder: a name and a date for the plan, and your own words on markets and times, risk per trade, a daily stop, exposure, entry and exit rules, routine and review. Text only, as you wrote it.",
    why: "So your plan is still there the next time you open the page in this browser. It is written as you type, when you import a plan file and when you clear the plan; it is never sent anywhere, and the key is removed when every answer is empty. The builder’s own JSON export is the backup.",

    holds: "The last day you answered the Academy’s question of the day, your run of days in a row, the longest run, and which answer you chose on that day and whether it was right. No addresses, no times and nothing about you.",
    why: "So the question of the day can show your run on its own page, on the Academy page and on My desk, and show the same result if you open it again the same day. Written only when you answer the day’s question; “Start over” on that page removes it. There is no account and no leaderboard, and nothing is sent anywhere.",
  },
  "gx:cards": {
    holds: "For each glossary flashcard you have graded: the term’s short name, which of the five boxes the card is in, and the day it is next due. No addresses, no times and nothing about you.",
    why: "So the glossary flashcards can show the cards that are due today, on their own page, on the glossary page and on My desk, and bring a card back later when you knew it and the next day when you did not. Written only when you grade a card; “Start over” on that page removes it. There is no account and no score, and nothing is sent anywhere.",
  },
  "gx:sim": {
    holds: "The state of the Practice desk simulation in Labs: its invented prices, the example account, example positions and orders, and the newest journal entries. No real prices, no real account and nothing about you.",
    why: "So a practice session survives a reload. Written only if you tick “Keep this practice session in this browser” on that page, which is off by default; unticking it deletes the key.",
